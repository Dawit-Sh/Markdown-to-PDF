- __Single File:__ Only Supports single file conversion in a dir, one file at a time. if there is any occurence of multiple markdown files in a directory, will assume as single file and compile to once  single PDF file.


## Usage
```bash
# git clone and set file executable and run
$ ./converter

# name the file when promted 
$ Enter PDF Name: awesome

```
